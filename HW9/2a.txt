Looking at the example given in the lecture, we can look at the duration of the activities. This can be done by (Fi-Si)
then we can try to combine the ones with the shortest duration. We will find that this is not nesscarily 
the optimal solution to the problem because our mutualy compatible condition is the decider if they activities enter the same set.
Therefore the combination we can get of the shortest duration in this example is 2 but the optimal is 4.
