The plot of the worst case, best case and average case senarios 
can be interpreted similarly because in all of the cases the complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2). 
This is because in each iteration of first loop selecting 
the minimum requires scanning n elements taking n-1 comparisons and then swapping it into the first position. 
Then we have to loop over over all the rest of 
the elements in the array in finding the next lowest element requires scanning the remaining n-1 elements and so on.
