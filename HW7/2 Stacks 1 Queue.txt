We can have two stacks stack 1 and stack 2 and for the en-queue operation the new element is entered at the top of stack1.
In de-queue operation, if stack2 is empty then all the elements are moved to stack2 and finally top of stack2 is returned.

enQueue(q,  x)
  1) Push x to stack1.

deQueue(q)
  1) If both stacks are empty then error.
  2) If stack2 is empty While stack1 is not empty, push everything from stack1 to stack2.
  3) Pop the element from stack2 and return it.
